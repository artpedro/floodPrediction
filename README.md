# Flood Prediction Solution

Welcome to my flood prediction solution! This repository showcases my approach to solving the classic flood prediction problem on Kaggle. The goal of this project is to train and build a predictive models using simple ANN in PyTorch.

## Project Overview

In this project, I tackle the flood prediction problem using various machine learning techniques. The main steps include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition on flood prediction. It contains historical weather data, river levels, and other relevant features. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/data).

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/artpedro/floodPrediction.git
    ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open the notebook file `Flood_Prediction_Solution.ipynb` and run the cells to see the analysis and results.

## Results

The key findings and model performance metrics are documented in the notebook. Some highlights include:

- **Data Insights**: Identified key relationship between features influencing flood occurrences through EDA.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved fairly high accuracy and precision with simple ANN model with a 0.86339 R2 score.

## TO-DO

- Train XGBoost and RandomForest models to improve performance
- Explore features transformations on dataset
